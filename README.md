# Understanding Germany’s Housing Market (1964–2024)

Our project explores how housing prices have changed in Germany over the past six decades. It takes a close look at how different cities have evolved some rising much faster than others and tries to understand what might be driving those changes.

The story is told through a series of clear visualizations, backed by carefully prepared data. It brings together real, quality adjusted housing price data from the GREIX index and combines it with national indicators like GDP, unemployment, and interest rates.

## What this project covers

- How housing prices have developed in each German city over time
- Where prices have grown the fastest and which cities have lagged behind
- When national forces seem to matter and when local dynamics take over
- How price inequality across cities has widened or narrowed during key periods

Each chart was built to make comparisons easy: between cities, over time, and across different housing types (apartments, single-family houses, and multi-family houses). Some sections highlight long term trends, others zoom in on turning points, like the boom after 2010 or the cooling after 2022.

The aim is not to predict prices or offer a model. It’s to step back and trace how German housing has changed—and ask better questions about what might happen next.
